This is a consumer/producer pair for launching and stopping videos playback on remote machines.
currently configured to use VLC, but there are also lines for omxplayer.
Videos must be an existing path on the remote machine.
Uses my pellets library to build off of a RabbitMQ durable messenger type.

I initially wrote this to start/stop playback of spooky videos for my halloween installations
