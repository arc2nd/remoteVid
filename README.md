This is a consumer/producer pair for launching and stopping videos playback on remote machines.
currently configured to use omxplayer, but is also workable with VLC.
Videos must be an existing path on the remote machine.
Uses my bites library to run off of a Mosquitto messenger broker.

I initially wrote this to start/stop playback of spooky videos for my halloween installations
